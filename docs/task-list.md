changelog:
  - "2026-02-12: Code Health Pt2 progress: extracted dashboard basic-poll action orchestration into `use-dashboard-basic-poll-actions`, further reduced dashboard complexity, and re-ran full web + e2e emulator validation."
  - "2026-02-12: Code Health Pt2 progress: extracted dashboard basic-poll source/derivation into dedicated hook+lib modules, split pending-invite/general-poll sidebar sections, reduced `DashboardPage.jsx` to 1352 lines, and added direct tests for `DashboardCalendar` + `useCalendarNavigation`."

# Quest Scheduler — Task List

## Plan Execution Checkpoint
- Last Completed: Code Health Pt2 Phase 4.1 fourth slice (dashboard basic-poll action orchestration extraction into hook) and expanded dashboard hotspot coverage.
- Next Step: Continue Code Health Pt2 Phase 4.1 with remaining modal/edit orchestration extraction, then begin Phase 4.2 scheduler-page decomposition.
- Open Issues: None in automated test gates.
- Last Updated (YYYY-MM-DD): 2026-02-12

- 2026-02-12: Discord ranked basic-poll voting hotfix:
  - Root cause from production logs (`processDiscordInteraction`):
    - `When querying a collection group and ordering by FieldPath.documentId() ... contains an odd number of segments.`
    - Triggered by `loadGroupBasicPollById` querying `collectionGroup("basicPolls")` with `documentId == pollId`.
  - Fix:
    - `functions/src/discord/worker.js`:
      - Replaced invalid documentId collection-group lookup with:
        - primary lookup via linked questing group (`discord.channelId`/`guildId`) then direct `questingGroups/{groupId}/basicPolls/{pollId}` fetch
        - fallback metadata lookup (`discord.messageId` then `discord.channelId`) and in-memory poll-id match
      - Updated callsites to pass `interaction` into poll resolution.
  - Test coverage:
    - `functions/src/discord/worker.basic-poll.test.js`:
      - Added regression guard that fails if `__name__`/documentId collection-group query is used for this flow.
  - Validation/deploy:
    - `npm --prefix functions run test -- src/discord/worker.basic-poll.test.js src/discord/worker.poll-create.test.js src/discord/worker.test.js` (pass, `24 passed`, exit code `0`).

  - Deploy results:
    - `./scripts/deploy-staging.sh` → pass (`https://quest-scheduler-stg.web.app`).

    - Added coverage for text-filter behavior across session/general poll cards.
    - Added coverage for status + date filter behavior across session/general poll cards.
- 2026-02-11: Validation for compact dashboard filter bar updates:
  - `npm --prefix web run test -- src/features/dashboard/DashboardPage.test.jsx` (pass, `9 passed`, exit code `0`).
  - `npm --prefix web run build` (pass; existing non-blocking chunk-size warnings).

- 2026-02-11: Implemented dashboard questing-group filter + dashboard general-poll creation flow:
  - `web/src/features/dashboard/DashboardPage.jsx`:
    - Added dashboard-level questing-group selector (`Dashboard filter`) that scopes session and general-poll lists to a selected group.
    - Added `+ New poll` action to the `General Polls` section (visible for questing-group members, enabled for group managers).
    - Wired dashboard create flow via `CreateGroupPollModal` and post-create dashboard refresh.
    - Added refresh nonce path so create/finalize/reopen/delete actions refresh dashboard general-poll sources.
  - `web/src/features/basic-polls/components/CreateGroupPollModal.jsx`:
    - Added dashboard mode with selectable questing group (reusing scheduler `QuestingGroupSelect` dropdown).
    - Preserved existing fixed-group settings flow behavior.
  - `web/src/features/scheduler/components/questing-group-select.jsx`:
    - Added optional `showNoneOption` prop for required-selection contexts.
  - Updated coverage:
    - `web/src/features/dashboard/DashboardPage.test.jsx`
    - `web/e2e/basic-poll-dashboard-embedded.spec.js` (dashboard card behavior alignment + create-from-dashboard flow)
- 2026-02-11: Validation for dashboard filter/create updates:
  - `npm --prefix web run test -- src/features/dashboard/DashboardPage.test.jsx` (pass, `7 passed`, exit code `0`).
  - `npm --prefix web run test -- src/features/dashboard/DashboardPage.test.jsx src/features/settings/SettingsPage.test.jsx src/lib/data/basicPolls.test.js` (pass, `37 passed`, exit code `0`).

- 2026-02-11: Deployed current workspace state to staging after timezone-label fix:
  - Command: `DEPLOY_ONLY=hosting,functions,storage,firestore:rules ./scripts/deploy-staging.sh`
  - Result: deploy succeeded (hosting release complete, functions updated, storage/firestore rules released).
  - Staging URL: `https://quest-scheduler-stg.web.app`

- 2026-02-11: Fixed auto-convert timezone label regression affecting Pacific/Auckland:
  - Root cause: timezone label parsing extracted uppercase letters and collapsed values like `GMT+13` into `GMT`.
  - Updated `web/src/lib/time.js` and `functions/src/discord/time-utils.js` to use the formatter-provided short timezone token directly with whitespace normalization only.
  - Added regression tests:
    - `web/src/lib/time.test.js`
    - `functions/src/discord/time-utils.test.js`
- 2026-02-11: Validation for timezone label regression fix:
  - `npm --prefix web run test -- src/lib/time.test.js` (pass, `6 passed`, exit code `0`).
  - `npm --prefix functions run test -- src/discord/time-utils.test.js src/discord/poll-card.test.js` (pass, `5 passed`, exit code `0`).

- 2026-02-11: Applied General Polls terminology + action-menu UX pass:
  - Dashboard card copy updated from `Basic Polls` to `General Polls` and subtitle shortened to `Standalone and add-on polls.`.
  - Added kebab menus to dashboard general poll cards (`web/src/components/polls/basic-poll-card.jsx`) with operations:
    - archive/unarchive
    - re-open (when finalized)
    - finalize (when open)
    - edit
    - delete
  - Wired dashboard action handlers in `web/src/features/dashboard/DashboardPage.jsx` for finalize/reopen/delete/edit across group + scheduler parent poll types.
  - Updated dashboard modal (`web/src/features/dashboard/components/group-basic-poll-modal.jsx`) so:
    - archive/unarchive is a dedicated header button
    - re-open is a dedicated header button (when finalized)
    - kebab menu includes finalize/edit/delete
  - Kept shared poll rendering centralized via `web/src/components/polls/basic-poll-voting-card.jsx` and reused in both scheduler and dashboard modal.
  - Renamed session-page embedded poll wording to add-on wording and changed add-on poll list to 2-column layout in `web/src/features/scheduler/SchedulerPage.jsx`.
  - Updated create/edit flow wording to add-on wording in `web/src/features/scheduler/CreateSchedulerPage.jsx`.
  - Updated notification preference labels in settings from basic-poll naming to general-poll naming in `web/src/features/settings/SettingsPage.jsx`.
- 2026-02-11: Validation for General Polls copy + menu/actions + add-on layout pass:
  - `npm --prefix web run test -- src/features/dashboard/DashboardPage.test.jsx src/lib/data/basicPolls.test.js src/features/settings/SettingsPage.test.jsx src/features/scheduler/components/finalize-embedded-polls-choice-dialog.test.jsx src/features/scheduler/components/EmbeddedPollEditorModal.test.jsx` (pass, `38 passed`, exit code `0`).
  - `npm --prefix web run build` (pass; existing non-blocking chunk-size warnings).
  - `DEPLOY_ONLY=hosting ./scripts/deploy-staging.sh` (pass; hosting released).
  - Staging URL: `https://quest-scheduler-stg.web.app`

- 2026-02-11: Implemented group basic-poll modal flow from dashboard and unified poll-card widgeting:
  - Added shared card component `web/src/components/polls/basic-poll-voting-card.jsx` extracted from scheduler embedded poll UI.
  - Refactored `web/src/features/scheduler/SchedulerPage.jsx` embedded poll list to render via `BasicPollVotingCard`.
  - Added `web/src/features/dashboard/components/group-basic-poll-modal.jsx` to render group polls in an in-dashboard desktop modal using the same voting card widget as embedded scheduler polls.
  - Updated `web/src/features/dashboard/DashboardPage.jsx`:
    - group basic polls open modal on desktop
    - mobile still navigates to route (`/groups/:groupId/polls/:pollId`)
  - Updated `web/src/components/polls/basic-poll-card.jsx` to support custom `onOpen` callback.
  - Added modal-open regression test in `web/src/features/dashboard/DashboardPage.test.jsx`.
- 2026-02-11: Validation for dashboard group-poll modal + shared basic poll voting card:
  - `npm --prefix web run test -- src/features/dashboard/DashboardPage.test.jsx src/lib/data/basicPolls.test.js` (pass, `32 passed`, exit code `0`).
  - `npm --prefix web run build` (pass; existing non-blocking chunk-size warnings).
  - `DEPLOY_ONLY=hosting ./scripts/deploy-staging.sh` (pass; hosting released).
  - Staging URL: `https://quest-scheduler-stg.web.app`

- 2026-02-11: Updated dashboard basic-poll interaction model to match session cards:
  - Removed inline `Vote/Edit vote/View results` button from `web/src/components/polls/basic-poll-card.jsx`.
  - Made entire basic-poll card clickable + keyboard accessible (`role="button"`, `Enter`/`Space`) with navigate/fallback behavior consistent with session cards.
  - Preserved archive/unarchive icon action and prevented navigation on archive button click via `stopPropagation`.
  - Updated assertions in `web/src/features/dashboard/DashboardPage.test.jsx` for card-level action label (`Edit vote: <title>`) instead of link buttons.
- 2026-02-11: Validation for basic-poll whole-card navigation update:
  - `npm --prefix web run test -- src/features/dashboard/DashboardPage.test.jsx src/lib/data/basicPolls.test.js` (pass, `31 passed`, exit code `0`).
  - `npm --prefix web run build` (pass; existing non-blocking chunk-size warnings).

- 2026-02-11: Improved dashboard basic-poll cards to align with session poll card UX:
  - Updated `web/src/components/polls/basic-poll-card.jsx` to mirror session-card interaction language:
    - card hover/lift motion (`hover:scale` + shadow)
    - white elevated card surface and shared spacing rhythm
    - title row chips aligned to session-card patterns
    - cleaner meta line (`context • deadline`)
    - avatar rows now use session-style copy and layout (`invitees`, `voted`, `pending`, `All voted!`)
  - Updated `web/src/features/dashboard/DashboardPage.jsx` to pass context accent color to basic-poll cards:
    - group polls use questing-group color
    - embedded polls use parent scheduler questing-group color when available
- 2026-02-11: Validation for basic-poll/session-card UX alignment pass:
  - `npm --prefix web run test -- src/features/dashboard/DashboardPage.test.jsx src/lib/data/basicPolls.test.js` (pass, `31 passed`, exit code `0`).
  - `npm --prefix web run build` (pass; existing non-blocking chunk-size warnings).

- 2026-02-11: Fixed dashboard basic-poll loading loop/regression on `feature/basic-poll-dashboard-ux`:
  - Root cause: basic-poll fetch effect depended on unstable derived objects/maps (`schedulerMetaById`, group maps, archived state), causing repeated fetches and `basicPollLoading` flip-flopping.
  - Refactor in `web/src/features/dashboard/DashboardPage.jsx`:
    - fetches now write only to `basicPollSourceItems` based on stable query keys
    - card state/classification is derived via `useMemo` from source items + local metadata
  - Added regression assertion in `web/src/features/dashboard/DashboardPage.test.jsx` to ensure a no-data render path performs only one fetch for each dashboard basic-poll source.
- 2026-02-11: Validation for dashboard basic-poll loading-loop fix:
  - `npm --prefix web run test -- src/features/dashboard/DashboardPage.test.jsx src/lib/data/basicPolls.test.js` (pass, `31 passed`, exit code `0`).
  - `npm --prefix web run build` (pass; existing non-blocking chunk-size warnings).

- 2026-02-11: Implemented dashboard basic-poll UX refresh on branch `feature/basic-poll-dashboard-ux`:
  - Added reusable card component `web/src/components/polls/basic-poll-card.jsx` with status chips, poll-type badges, voting avatar stacks, and archive/unarchive actions.
  - Expanded dashboard data loaders in `web/src/lib/data/basicPolls.js` to fetch and normalize both group basic polls and embedded scheduler basic polls for tabbed dashboard views.
  - Refactored `web/src/features/dashboard/DashboardPage.jsx` to render a new `Basic Polls` section with tabs (`Needs vote`, `Open voted`, `Closed`, `Archived`) and shared card rendering.
  - Updated coverage in:
    - `web/src/lib/data/basicPolls.test.js`
    - `web/src/features/dashboard/DashboardPage.test.jsx`
- 2026-02-11: Validation and deploy for dashboard basic-poll UX refresh:
  - `npm --prefix web run test -- src/features/dashboard/DashboardPage.test.jsx src/lib/data/basicPolls.test.js` (pass, `31 passed`, exit code `0`).
  - `npm --prefix web run build` (pass; existing non-blocking chunk-size warning).
  - `./scripts/deploy-staging.sh` (fails on Firestore index sync: HTTP `400` "this index is not necessary, configure using single field index controls").
  - `DEPLOY_ONLY=hosting ./scripts/deploy-staging.sh` (pass; hosting released successfully).
  - Staging URL: `https://quest-scheduler-stg.web.app`

- 2026-02-11: Implemented independent embedded-poll finalize/reopen controls for scheduler polls and updated scheduler finalization UX:
  - Scheduler creators can now finalize or reopen any embedded poll individually from the embedded poll card (`Finalize poll` / `Re-open poll`).
  - Finalizing a session winner now prompts when unfinalized embedded polls exist: choose `Finalize session only` or `Finalize session + embedded polls`.
  - If `Finalize session only` is chosen, scheduler finalizes while embedded polls remain votable until individually finalized.
  - Backend callable support now includes scheduler parent paths for poll finalize/reopen (`finalizeBasicPoll`, `reopenBasicPoll`).
  - Firestore rules now allow embedded poll voting when scheduler is `FINALIZED` as long as embedded poll is `OPEN`, deadline not passed, and scheduler is not `CANCELLED`.
- 2026-02-11: Validation for embedded poll independent finalize/reopen flow:
  - `npm --prefix functions run test -- src/basic-polls/callables.test.js` (pass, `19 passed`, exit code `0`).
  - `npm --prefix web run test -- src/lib/data/basicPolls.test.js src/features/scheduler/components/finalize-embedded-polls-choice-dialog.test.jsx` (pass, `26 passed`, exit code `0`).
  - `XDG_CONFIG_HOME=/tmp/firebase-config npm --prefix web run test:rules` (pass, `21 passed`, exit code `0`).
  - `firebase emulators:exec --only auth,functions,firestore,storage "npm --prefix web run test -- --config vitest.integration.config.js --run src/__tests__/integration/basic-polls.integration.test.js"` (pass, exit code `0`; emulator logs include unrelated notification trigger noise but suite completed successfully).
  - `set -a; source web/.env.e2e.local; set +a; firebase emulators:exec --only auth,firestore,functions,storage --log-verbosity SILENT "node functions/scripts/seed-e2e-scheduler.js && npm --prefix web run test:e2e -- e2e/basic-poll-embedded-finalize-controls.spec.js"` (pass, `2 passed`, `6 skipped`, exit code `0`).

- 2026-02-11: Re-pushed staging after Tailwind typography plugin enablement for markdown rendering:
  - Command: `DEPLOY_ONLY=hosting,functions,storage,firestore:rules ./scripts/deploy-staging.sh`
  - Result: deploy succeeded; hosting released, unchanged functions skipped.
  - Staging URL: `https://quest-scheduler-stg.web.app`

- 2026-02-11: Fixed markdown styling (headings/emphasis/link appearance) for all ReactMarkdown surfaces:
  - Root cause: `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin was not installed/configured, so `prose` classes had no generated styles.
  - Added dependency: `@tailwindcss/typography` in `web/package.json`.
  - Updated `web/tailwind.config.js` to include `tailwindTypography` plugin.
  - Standardized markdown wrapper classes across basic-poll and embedded-poll components to use:
    - `prose prose-sm prose-slate ... dark:prose-invert`
    - explicit link styling via `prose-a:text-brand-primary prose-a:underline`.
  - Affected files:
    - `web/src/features/basic-polls/GroupPollPage.jsx`
    - `web/src/features/basic-polls/components/CreateGroupPollModal.jsx`
    - `web/src/features/scheduler/SchedulerPage.jsx`
    - `web/src/features/scheduler/components/EmbeddedPollEditorModal.jsx`
- 2026-02-11: Validation for markdown styling fix:

    - Added read-mode `View note` affordances across vote/results rows and a scrollable markdown note modal.
  - Updated `web/src/features/scheduler/SchedulerPage.jsx`:
    - Rendered embedded poll descriptions as markdown in scheduler vote cards.
    - Added embedded poll `View note` actions (multiple-choice, ranked, and finalized/result rows) with a read-only markdown note modal.
  - Added/updated coverage:
    - `web/src/features/basic-polls/GroupPollPage.test.jsx` now covers read-mode markdown description rendering and option-note modal rendering.
    - `web/e2e/basic-poll-dashboard-embedded.spec.js` now validates opening/closing an embedded option-note modal from a deep-linked scheduler poll.
    - `functions/scripts/seed-e2e-scheduler.js` now seeds markdown description + option note for the dashboard embedded poll fixture.
- 2026-02-11: Validation for markdown + option-note fixes:
  - `npm --prefix web run test -- src/features/basic-polls/GroupPollPage.test.jsx` (pass, `16 passed`, exit code `0`).
  - `set -a; source web/.env.e2e.local; set +a; firebase emulators:exec --only auth,firestore,functions,storage --log-verbosity SILENT "node functions/scripts/seed-e2e-scheduler.js && npm --prefix web run test:e2e -- e2e/basic-poll-dashboard-embedded.spec.js"` (pass, chromium `1 passed`; non-chromium projects skipped by spec guard).

- 2026-02-11: Added E2E coverage for embedded poll management on scheduler edit pages:
  - Added dedicated seed fixtures in `functions/scripts/seed-e2e-scheduler.js`:
    - `E2E_EMBEDDED_EDITOR_SCHEDULER_ID` (`e2e-embedded-editor-scheduler`)
    - `E2E_EMBEDDED_EDITOR_POLL_ID` (`e2e-embedded-editor-existing-poll`)

    - create session poll
    - verify embedded poll persists on resulting scheduler edit page
- 2026-02-11: Validation for embedded poll create-flow E2E coverage:
  - `set -a; source web/.env.e2e.local; set +a; firebase emulators:exec --only auth,firestore,functions,storage --log-verbosity SILENT "node functions/scripts/seed-e2e-scheduler.js && npm --prefix web run test:e2e -- e2e/basic-poll-embedded-create.spec.js"` (pass; chromium `1 passed`, non-chromium projects skipped by spec guard).

- 2026-02-11: Fixed create-mode embedded poll authoring on `Create Session Poll`:
  - `web/src/features/scheduler/CreateSchedulerPage.jsx` now shows the Embedded polls section in both create and edit flows.
  - Added local draft embedded poll management for create flow (add/edit/remove/reorder before scheduler exists), then persisted drafts immediately after scheduler creation.
  - Existing edit-mode behavior remains server-backed and unchanged.
  - Added helper utilities in `web/src/features/scheduler/utils/embedded-poll-drafts.js`.

    - Failure: Firestore index API HTTP 400: "this index is not necessary, configure using single field index controls".
  - Successful retry with Firestore rules only:
    - `DEPLOY_ONLY=hosting,functions,storage,firestore:rules ./scripts/deploy-staging.sh` (pass, exit code `0`).

  - Embedded poll status remains parent-derived (no independent embedded status field management in docs/writes).
  - Firestore parent-status write enforcement from `P1 1.2` continues to backstop UI gating.
- 2026-02-11: Test results for `P1 4.4`:
  - `npm --prefix web run test -- src/features/scheduler/components/EmbeddedPollEditorModal.test.jsx src/features/settings/components/GroupCard.test.jsx src/features/basic-polls/GroupPollPage.test.jsx src/lib/data/basicPolls.test.js src/lib/basic-polls/irv.test.js` (pass, `43 passed`, exit code `0`).

  - `npm --prefix functions run test -- src/basic-polls/irv.test.js` (pass, `7 passed`, exit code `0`).
  - `npm --prefix web run build` (pass; Vite build completed with existing non-blocking chunk-size warnings).
- 2026-02-11: Completed `basic-poll` task `P1 5.3` (Finalized result snapshots):
  - `web/src/lib/data/basicPolls.js`: `finalizeBasicPoll(...)` now computes immutable `finalResults` snapshots from current vote docs (multiple-choice and ranked-choice) and writes `status`, `finalizedAt`, `finalResults`, and `updatedAt` together.
  - `functions/src/legacy.js`: `googleCalendarFinalizePoll` now computes and stores `finalResults` snapshots for each embedded basic poll before finalizing the parent scheduler.
  - `web/src/features/basic-polls/GroupPollPage.jsx`: finalized polls now read `poll.finalResults` as the canonical source for closed results (fallbacks preserved for non-snapshot legacy docs).
  - `web/src/features/scheduler/SchedulerPage.jsx`: embedded poll cards now render closed-state final results from each poll’s `finalResults` snapshot and use snapshot `voterCount` when available.
  - Added functions multiple-choice utility for server snapshots at `functions/src/basic-polls/multiple-choice.js`.
- 2026-02-11: Test results for `P1 5.3`:
