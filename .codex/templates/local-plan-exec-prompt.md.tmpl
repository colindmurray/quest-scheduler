You are executing the "__PLAN_ID__" long-running implementation plan in this repository.

Primary sources (read first):
- AGENTS.md
- __PLAN_DOC__
- __TASKS_DOC__
- __EXEC_TASK_LIST__
- docs/task-list.md
- docs/testing.md
- docs/decisions.md

Execution requirements:
1. Use the `__EXECUTION_SKILL__` skill workflow.
2. Operate in local Codex CLI mode only. Never use `codex cloud` commands.
3. Execute tasks in priority order from `__TASKS_DOC__` (P0/P1/P2/P3..., then numeric order).
4. Implement in small, reviewable chunks.
5. After each chunk:
   - update `__EXEC_TASK_LIST__` statuses and checkpoint
   - update `docs/task-list.md` checkpoint + progress notes
   - run relevant tests and record exact commands/results
6. Mark a task complete only after implementation and validation.
7. Continue autonomously until blocked or all tasks are complete.

If blocked:
- document blockers in both tracker files
- continue with the next safe unblocked task when possible
